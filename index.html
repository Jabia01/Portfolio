    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Joshua — a cybersecurity enthusiast focused on both offensive and defensive security.
I'm currently sharpening my skills through hands-on labs on TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and Blue Team Labs, where I actively explore system vulnerabilities, scripting, and automation.
I come from a strong science background, having earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Lagos, Nigeria, where I developed deep analytical and technical reasoning.
After graduating, I quickly transitioned into tech. My first role was as a sales representative at a company in Lagos, Nigeria, where my constant interaction with electronic devices sparked a growing curiosity about how computers really work. My performance in that role led to a promotion into technical support, which ultimately solidified my decision to pursue a full-time career in technology and cybersecurity.
